# FC Barcelona Performance Analytics: A Data Science Project

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end data science analysis of FC Barcelona’s competitive performance from 2008 to 2025.

The objective is to design a modular analytical system that processes match-level data, derives structured performance metrics, applies rolling statistical analysis, and visualizes long-term structural trends through an interactive dashboard.

This project demonstrates applied data analysis, feature engineering, time-series reasoning, and scalable software design.

## Problem Statement

How has FC Barcelona’s performance evolved over time, and how can short-term form fluctuations and long-term structural trends be quantified using data?

This project addresses:

- Short-term performance volatility using rolling metrics  
- Long-term season trends using aggregated features  
- Era-based structural performance differences  
- Quantitative comparison across competitive phases  

---

## Key Quantitative Findings

The analysis identifies distinct structural phases in performance:

- 🏆 **Peak Season:** 2012–2013 with 100 league points  
- 📉 **Lowest Season:** 2021–2022 with 73 points  
- 🔥 **Highest Dominance Index:** 2014–2015  
- 📊 **Strongest Era by Average Points:** Tito Era  
- ⚠️ **Largest Performance Decline:** Post-Messi period  

These findings demonstrate measurable dominance cycles and post-transition volatility.

---

## Data Pipeline

The project follows a structured data workflow:

1. Raw match data ingestion  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature engineering (points, goal difference, rolling averages)  
4. Aggregation to season-level metrics  
5. Analytical modeling and visualization  

The modular design ensures separation between data engineering, analytical computation, and presentation layers.

---

## Key Analytical Components

### 1. Feature Engineering

Derived structured features including:

- Points per match  
- Goal difference  
- Cumulative season statistics  
- Rolling averages (form indicators)  
- Dominance index  

These engineered features enable quantitative comparison across competitive periods.

---

### 2. Rolling Time-Series Analysis

Implemented moving window calculations to model short-term form trends.

Techniques used:

- Rolling mean  
- Window-based aggregation  
- Time-indexed modeling  

This enables detection of:

- Momentum shifts  
- Performance instability periods  
- Structural turning points  

---

### 3. Era-Based Comparative Analysis

Defined temporal segments representing competitive phases and compared:

- Average points  
- Goal differential  
- Dominance metrics  

This enables structural performance comparison beyond isolated season-level evaluation.

---

### 4. Interactive Analytical Dashboard

Developed using Streamlit to:

- Visualize long-term season trends  
- Explore rolling performance dynamics  
- Compare performance metrics across eras  
- Adjust rolling window parameters interactively  

The dashboard separates analytical computation from presentation logic.
